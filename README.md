### 🚀 About Me

I'm a backend developer who lives for writing clean, efficient code and automating boring stuff. While most people fear the command line, I feel *at home* there.

I specialize in **Python** and **SQL**, and I believe front-end is best left to those who enjoy it. I'm obsessed with how things work under the hood and love diving deep into the backend of systems.

### 🛠️ Technologies I Enjoy

- 🐍 **Python** – my programming language of choice
- 🗃️ **PostgreSQL / SQLite** – sick database hacker man stuff
- ⚡ **FastAPI** – for building slick APIs

---

### 🧠 Currently Learning

- Advance / Intermiddiate Python
- Beginner SQL

---

### 🧰 Notable Projects

- 📈 [`tgju-api`](https://github.com/MrMM7/tgju-api): A Python wrapper for TGJU’s financial data, making it easy to pull gold, currency, and crypto prices in seconds. 
- 🕵️‍♂️ *Unannounced Projects*: planning something BIG 👀

---

### 💬 Let's Talk Code

I'm not just learning backend — I'm **building** with it.

Always down to:
- 🧠 Brainstorm weird-but-awesome backend ideas
- 🛠️ Debug Garbage Python code 

If it's backend-related, I’m in.
