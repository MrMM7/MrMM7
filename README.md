# 👋 Hey, I'm a 14 y/o C++ enjoyer

I write code to understand things.  
C++ is the chaos I’ve chosen to master.

---

### 💡 What I’m doing:
- Experimenting with architecture, rendering, and low-level design
- Learning by breaking, fixing, and repeating
- Always switching languages, but for now C++ is what I enjoy.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Apps I vibe with:
- **C++** (my main and new Language)
- **C#** (Unity stuff sometimes)
- **Git** (no code without version control)
- **JetBrains CLion** (because I can't figure out how to make the compiler work)
- **Blender** (for simple 3D modeling)
- **Unity** (because 2D/3D game dev is life)

---

### 🧠 Goals:
- Understand how things *really* work under the hood
- Build reusable systems for future projects
- Become the kind of dev who can make things, not just use them

---

Thanks for stopping by.  
Maybe one day I’ll go public with what I’m building.  
Until then — just know I’m cooking frfr. 🔥
